### 1. **Utilize Multiple Emulators and Simulators**

React Native's development environment supports running your app on different device emulators and simulators. For Android, you can create virtual devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions using Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager. For iOS, Xcode's Simulator allows you to test on different iPhone and iPad models. This approach helps you observe how your app adapts to different screen dimensions and orientations.

### 2. **Test on Physical Devices**

While emulators and simulators are convenient, testing on actual devices is essential to capture real-world performance and responsiveness. Physical devices can reveal issues related to touch responsiveness, hardware limitations, and other nuances that emulators might not accurately simulate.

### 3. **Use Online Responsive Testing Tools**

Although primarily designed for web development, some online tools can aid in visualizing responsiveness:

- **BrowserStack Live**: Provides real-time access to a wide range of devices and browsers, allowing you to test your app's responsiveness across different environments.

- **Responsively App**: An open-source tool that displays your app across multiple device frames simultaneously, helping you identify layout issues quickly.

These tools can be particularly useful when testing web components or React Native Web implementations.
