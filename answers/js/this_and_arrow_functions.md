**Definition:**  
In JavaScript, `this` refers to the object that is executing the function. **Arrow functions do not have their own `this`**, instead, they inherit `this` from their surrounding lexical context. Regular functions get their own `this`, which depends on how they are called.

**Explanation:**  
In React functional components, the confusion around `this` is mostly relevant inside event handlers or callbacks. If you use a **regular function**, `this` may be `undefined` or not what you expect, especially when used inside objects or hooks. Arrow functions **inherit `this`** from their lexical scope, making them safer and more predictable in such scenarios.

**Example (React Function Component):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function NormalFunctionExample() {
  const obj = {
    name: 'React',
    clickHandler: function () {
      console.log(this.name); // 'this' refers to obj
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={obj.clickHandler}>
      Normal Function
    </button>
  );
}

function ArrowFunctionExample() {
  const name = 'React';
  const obj = {
    name,
    clickHandler: () => {
      console.log(name); // 'this' not needed
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={obj.clickHandler}>
      Arrow Function
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Conclusion:**  
Arrow functions simplify React callbacks because they donâ€™t require binding and avoid common `this` pitfalls, especially inside hooks or nested objects.
