Yes, you can absolutely use plain JavaScript objects for styling in React Native. Every style property in React Native is essentially a key–value pair defined in a JavaScript object. For example, you can do this:

```jsx
<View style={{ margin: 10, padding: 5, backgroundColor: 'blue' }}>
  <Text style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: 16 }}>Hello World</Text>
</View>
```

However, while inline styles using plain objects work perfectly, there are a few reasons why the official recommendation is to use the StyleSheet API (i.e. `StyleSheet.create()`):

• **Performance:** When you use `StyleSheet.create()`, React Native pre-processes and freezes the style objects, which can reduce overhead during re-renders. This caching helps avoid creating new objects on every render, potentially improving performance especially in components that re-render frequently.

• **Maintainability and Consistency:** Using a centralized stylesheet makes your code more organized and consistent. It separates styling from layout logic, making it easier to maintain and update styles across your app.

• **Validation and Warnings:** The StyleSheet API also provides a layer of validation for style properties. If you mistakenly use an unsupported style property or value, it can warn you during development.

In summary, while plain JavaScript objects are completely acceptable and sometimes even necessary (for dynamic or computed styles), using `StyleSheet.create()` is generally preferred for static styles due to the performance and maintainability benefits it provides.
