**Interviewer:** *In Zustand, can one store access or modify the state of another store? If so, how would you approach this, and are there any considerations to keep in mind?*

**Candidate:**

Yes, in Zustand, one store can access or even modify the state of another store. This is achieved by importing the other store and using its `getState()` method to retrieve the current state or invoke actions.îˆ†

**Accessing Another Store's State:**

For example, suppose we have two stores: `useUserStore` and `useSettingsStore`.

```javascript
// userStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand';

export const useUserStore = create((set) => ({
  userId: null,
  setUserId: (id) => set({ userId: id }),
}));
```

```javascript
// settingsStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand';
import { useUserStore } from './userStore';

export const useSettingsStore = create((set) => ({
  updateSettings: () => {
    const userId = useUserStore.getState().userId;
    // Perform update logic using userId
  },
}));
```


In this setup, `useSettingsStore` accesses the `userId` from `useUserStore` using `getState()`.

**Considerations:**

- **Reactivity:** Accessing state via `getState()` is not reactive. If `userId` changes in `useUserStore`, `useSettingsStore` won't automatically respond to that change.

- **Coordination Complexity:** Zustand isn't inherently designed for tightly coupled store interactions. If multiple stores need to coordinate closely, it might be more effective to combine them into a single store with slices to manage different state domains.

- **Alternative Approaches:** For reactive cross-store interactions, consider using subscriptions or middleware. Alternatively, libraries like Jotai or Valtio might offer more suitable patterns for such scenarios.

In summary, while Zustand allows one store to access another's state, it's essential to be mindful of reactivity and maintainability. Depending on the application's complexity, consolidating related states into a single store might be more appropriate.
