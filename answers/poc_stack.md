**Interviewer:** *If you're creating a proof of concept (POC), should you choose Expo or bare React Native?*

**Candidate:**

When developing a proof of concept (POC), the primary goal is to validate ideas quickly and efficiently. In this context, **Expo** is often the preferred choice due to its streamlined setup and rapid development capabilities.

**Reasons to Choose Expo for a POC:**

- **Rapid Development:** Expo offers a managed workflow that abstracts much of the native configuration, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than setting up the environment. This accelerates the development process, which is crucial for POCs.

- **Ease of Use:** With Expo, there's no need to install native development tools like Xcode or Android Studio initially. Developers can start coding immediately and preview their apps using the Expo Go app on physical devices.

- **Comprehensive SDK:** Expo provides a rich set of pre-built components and APIs for common functionalities such as camera access, location services, and push notifications. This reduces the need to integrate third-party libraries for basic features.

- **Simplified Deployment:** Expo's build and deployment tools simplify the process of sharing the app for testing or demonstration purposes, which is beneficial during the POC phase.

**Considerations:**

While Expo is advantageous for rapid prototyping, it's important to note that it may have limitations if the POC requires custom native modules or advanced performance optimizations. In such cases, starting with a bare React Native setup might be more appropriate.

**Conclusion:**

For most POCs, Expo provides a faster and more convenient development experience, enabling teams to validate concepts without the overhead of configuring native environments. However, if the project demands extensive native customizations from the outset, opting for bare React Native could be more suitable.
