The new React Native architecture represents a significant shift from the classic bridge-based model by rethinking how JavaScript and native code interact. At its core, the new design removes the traditional asynchronous bridge and replaces it with a more efficient, synchronous communication layer based on the JavaScript Interface (JSI). This change, along with other architectural updates like Fabric and TurboModules, helps reduce latency and improve performance. Let’s break down the architecture in terms of its threads and components:

**1. JavaScript Thread**  
• **Role:** This thread runs your app’s business logic and React code (including hooks and components).  
• **JSI Impact:** Instead of serializing data to JSON and sending it over a bridge, JSI allows the JavaScript thread to directly reference and invoke native functions. This reduces overhead and speeds up communication with native modules.

**2. Shadow (Layout) Thread**  
• **Role:** Traditionally, React Native used a shadow thread to calculate layouts using the Yoga engine. In the new architecture, while Yoga might still be used in some contexts, Fabric—the new rendering engine—tightly integrates with the layout process.  
• **Function:** This thread computes the layout (the “shadow tree”) of your components, preparing the data needed for the UI without blocking the main UI thread. This separation helps in offloading heavy layout calculations and contributes to smoother UI updates.

**3. UI (Main) Thread**  
• **Role:** This is where native UI components are actually rendered.  
• **Fabric Renderer:** With the introduction of Fabric, the UI thread now works with a renderer that can update native views more efficiently. Fabric receives a well-prepared layout from the shadow thread (often with minimal serialization, thanks to JSI) and commits those changes directly to the native view hierarchy.

**Additional Architectural Enhancements:**

- **TurboModules:**  
  TurboModules allow native modules to be loaded on demand rather than all at startup. This lazy loading reduces startup time and memory consumption, ensuring that only the necessary modules are in memory.

- **Concurrent Rendering & Automatic Batching:**  
  With support for React 18 features like concurrent rendering, React Native can batch state updates more effectively. This minimizes unnecessary re-renders and ensures that user interactions—like scrolling or animations—remain fluid even during intensive updates.

**Overall Flow:**  
In the old architecture, every interaction between the JavaScript code and native modules required JSON serialization over an asynchronous bridge, which could introduce delays and cause occasional performance bottlenecks (for example, during complex animations or heavy UI updates). In contrast, the new architecture uses JSI to establish a direct connection between the JavaScript thread and native code. This connection is more like a set of function pointers or method references in C++—allowing synchronous calls that bypass the overhead of serialization. Meanwhile, Fabric takes over UI rendering by working closely with the shadow thread to measure and commit layouts synchronously, thereby reducing visual glitches and improving responsiveness.

In summary, the new architecture divides responsibilities among three key threads—the JavaScript thread (for logic and state), the shadow thread (for layout calculations), and the UI thread (for rendering)—and uses JSI to streamline communication. Combined with TurboModules for on-demand module loading and Fabric for a modernized rendering process, this architecture enables React Native apps to be faster, smoother, and more resource-efficient.
