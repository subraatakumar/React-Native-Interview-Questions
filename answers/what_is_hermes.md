Hermes is an open‐source JavaScript engine developed by Facebook specifically for React Native apps. Its main goal is to optimize the performance of mobile applications, particularly on lower-end devices. Here are the key points about Hermes:

• **Optimized for Mobile:**  
Hermes is designed to work efficiently on mobile platforms. It features ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, which converts JavaScript code into bytecode before the app is launched. This reduces the work done at runtime, leading to faster startup times and lower memory usage.

• **Improved Runtime Performance:**  
By minimizing the overhead associated with parsing and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, Hermes provides more consistent and predictable performance. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where quick responsiveness is critical—such as in animations or data-intensive operations.

• **Efficient Garbage Collection:**  
Hermes includes an optimized garbage collector tailored for the constrained memory environments of mobile devices, ensuring smoother performance and reducing the chances of stutters or frame drops.

• **Integration with React Native:**  
Hermes is often enabled by default on Android (and can be optionally enabled on iOS) in React Native projects. It works seamlessly with the new React Native architecture by reducing the overhead of JavaScript execution, which, combined with technologies like JSI and Fabric, leads to an overall more efficient and responsive application.

In summary, Hermes is a lightweight, mobile-optimized JavaScript engine that improves React Native app performance by reducing startup times, lowering memory consumption, and providing smoother interactions—all by compiling code ahead of time and streamlining runtime execution.
