JSI stands for JavaScript Interface. In React Native’s new architecture (available since around version 0.68 and refined in 0.79), JSI replaces the traditional bridge by providing a low-level, C++ based interface that allows JavaScript code to hold references to native objects and call native methods directly. 

Instead of converting data to JSON and sending it asynchronously over the bridge (which can introduce latency and performance overhead), JSI enables synchronous and efficient, binary-level communication between the JavaScript runtime (such as Hermes or JavaScriptCore) and native modules. This direct connection allows for better performance—especially in data-intensive operations and animations—and opens the door to new patterns like Fabric for UI rendering and TurboModules for on-demand native module loading.

Essentially, with JSI:
• JavaScript can interact with native code more directly without the extra cost of serialization and deserialization.
• Native objects can be referenced and manipulated within JavaScript, similar to how the DOM is manipulated in web development.
• The overall responsiveness of the app improves, and it becomes easier to write high-performance, cross-platform features.
