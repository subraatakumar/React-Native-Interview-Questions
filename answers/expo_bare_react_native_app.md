**Interviewer:** *Can we use Expo packages in a bare React Native app?*

**Candidate:**

Yes, we can integrate Expo packages into a bare React Native app by leveraging Expo's modular architecture. This approach allows us to benefit from Expo's well-maintained libraries and tools without fully adopting the managed workflow.

**Steps to Integrate Expo Modules into a Bare React Native App:**

1. **Install Expo Modules:**

   We begin by running the following command to install and configure Expo modules:

   ```bash
   npx install-expo-modules@latest
   ```


   This command sets up the necessary infrastructure to use Expo packages in our project.

2. **Install Specific Expo Packages:**

   After the initial setup, we can add any desired Expo package using:

   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-camera
   ```


   This ensures that the package and its dependencies are correctly installed and linked.

3. **Configure Native Projects:**

   - **iOS:** Navigate to the `ios` directory and run:îˆ†

     ```bash
     npx pod-install
     ```

     This installs the necessary CocoaPods dependencies.

   - **Android:** Typically, no additional steps are required as autolinking handles the integration.

**Benefits of This Approach:**

- **Access to Expo's Ecosystem:** We can utilize a wide range of Expo's native modules, such as `expo-camera`, `expo-location`, and `expo-notifications`.

- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Expo's tools, like EAS Build and Expo CLI, can streamline development and deployment processes.

- **Flexibility:** We maintain full control over native code, allowing for custom native module development alongside Expo's offerings.

**Considerations:**

- **Compatibility:** Not all Expo packages are compatible with the bare workflow. It's essential to consult the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview/) to verify compatibility.

- **Maintenance:** Integrating Expo modules requires keeping both React Native and Expo dependencies up to date to ensure stability.

In summary, integrating Expo packages into a bare React Native app is a viable strategy to leverage Expo's robust ecosystem while retaining the flexibility of the bare workflow.
