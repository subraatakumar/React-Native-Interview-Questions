There are several techniques to write platform-specific code in React Native, ensuring that your app behaves appropriately on both iOS and Android. Here are the primary methods:

• **Platform Module:**  
React Native provides a built-in `Platform` module (imported from `'react-native'`) which you can use to conditionally execute code based on the operating system. For example, you can write conditional logic with `Platform.OS === 'ios'` or use `Platform.select()` to define values for different platforms in one go:

```jsx
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const styles = {
  padding: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 10 : 8,
  backgroundColor: Platform.select({ ios: 'blue', android: 'green' }),
};
```

• **File Naming Conventions:**  
You can create separate files for each platform by following naming conventions. For instance, if you have a component file named `MyComponent.ios.js` for iOS and `MyComponent.android.js` for Android, React Native automatically picks the correct file when bundling the app. This method is ideal when the entire component’s implementation differs by platform.
