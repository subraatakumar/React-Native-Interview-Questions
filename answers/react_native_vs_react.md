React Native is a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook that lets you build mobile applications using the same concepts as React—but instead of rendering components to a browser’s DOM, it renders them to native UI elements on iOS and Android devices. 

In React for the web, you typically work with HTML elements (like div, span, img) and style them with CSS. The framework builds a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render UI changes in the browser. In contrast, React Native replaces HTML tags with its own set of core components such as `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<Image>`, which directly correspond to native UI elements on mobile platforms. This direct mapping enables a more “native” look and feel and typically results in better performance for mobile apps.

Additionally, while React web apps use traditional CSS (or CSS-in-JS solutions) for styling, React Native uses a StyleSheet API where styles are defined as JavaScript objects. There are also subtle differences in layout—React Native relies on Flexbox for layout but comes with defaults (like a column-based layout) that differ from standard CSS on the web.

To summarise, React Native leverages the power of native components allowing developers to build cross-platform mobile apps using javascript, while React for the web is optimized for building user interfaces within a browser environment using javascript.
