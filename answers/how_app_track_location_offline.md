## 📴 How does `Location.watchPositionAsync` fetch location **when the user is offline**?

### 🧠 Short Answer:
Yes, **it can still fetch location offline**, but **with limitations** depending on the device’s sensors and what’s cached.

---

### 🛰️ 1. **GPS Works Without Internet**

- GPS is a **satellite-based system**, so it **doesn't need internet**.
- As long as the device has a **clear view of the sky**, GPS can provide accurate location (especially outdoors).
- This is why apps like Google Maps can still show your location **offline** (but can’t load map tiles).

✅ So if `watchPositionAsync` is set with high accuracy, it will use **GPS** even without Wi-Fi or mobile data.

### 📶 2. **Wi-Fi & Cell Tower Positioning Need Internet**

- Wi-Fi and cell-based location need **access to a database of Wi-Fi access points and towers**, which is stored in the cloud.
- When offline, these may give:
  - **Stale/cached location** (if recently used)
  - Or **no result at all** (if new area)

So:
| Tech              | Works Offline? | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| GPS               | ✅ Yes          | ✅ High (within ~5 meters) |
| Wi-Fi             | ⚠️ Sometimes (if cached) | Medium (~20–50 meters) |
| Cell Towers       | ⚠️ Limited      | Low (~100–1000 meters) |

---

### 🧪 Real Example: What Happens Offline?

Let’s say:
- You go for a hike with airplane mode ON
- You have `watchPositionAsync` running with high accuracy
- Your phone’s GPS chip will **still receive satellite signals** and provide updates

But:
- If you're indoors or in a dense city where GPS is weak
- And there's no cached Wi-Fi or tower data
- → You might get **no location** or very slow updates

---

### 🔒 Permissions Are Still Required!

Even offline, the app must have:
- Location permission (`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync`)
- And location services (like GPS) must be **enabled in settings**

---

### ✅ Summary

| Condition | Can it fetch location offline? | Source |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------|
| Outdoors with GPS | ✅ Yes | GPS |
| Indoors without internet | ⚠️ Maybe (if cached) | Wi-Fi/Cell |
| Airplane mode | ✅ Yes (GPS still works) | GPS |
| No GPS, no cache | ❌ No | None |
